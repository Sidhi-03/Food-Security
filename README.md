# 🥗 Food Security Analysis — Reducing Food Waste Using Data Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **food waste data** to enhance **food security**. Using a dataset from **Kaggle**, the goal is to identify key patterns and insights that can help reduce food waste and contribute to the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** —  
**SDG 2: Zero Hunger** and **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To explore and analyze food waste data to understand the underlying causes and patterns of food waste across production, distribution, and consumption stages.  
The project aims to derive actionable insights that support better planning, awareness, and sustainable food management.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Even with sufficient food production, a large portion is wasted at various stages of the supply chain — leading to inefficiency, hunger, and environmental harm.  
This analysis seeks to identify where and why waste occurs, and what strategies can help minimize it.

---

## 🌍 Significance
Reducing food waste improves **resource efficiency**, enhances **food availability**, and supports **sustainable practices**.  
By understanding key waste factors, stakeholders can develop data-backed strategies for:
- Better logistics and storage management  
- Consumer awareness and behavioral change  
- Policy-level decision-making  

---

## 🧠 Data Description
The dataset (sourced from **Kaggle**) contains:
- Food type and category  
- Quantity wasted  
- Reasons for waste  
- Geographical location  
- Supply chain stage (production, distribution, consumption)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries  
- Handled missing values through imputation/deletion  
- Standardized data formats and measurement units  
- Detected and treated outliers  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Normalized numerical data for uniformity  

---

## 🔍 Tools and Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Methods and Analysis
- Descriptive and inferential statistics  
- Visualization of waste patterns across regions and food types  
- Regression, clustering, and classification models to identify trends and key influencing factors  

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Maximum waste occurs at the **consumption stage**  
- **Fruits and vegetables** are the most wasted items  
- **Seasonal variations** impact food waste levels  

---

## 💭 Insights & Recommendations
- Improving **storage and transportation** can reduce waste at the distribution stage  
- Educating **consumers on proper food storage** can reduce household waste  
- Policy focus should be on logistics optimization and community awareness  

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses
1. Educating consumers on food storage techniques reduces household food waste.  
2. Improving supply chain logistics decreases waste during distribution.

---

## 🧾 Testing Approach
- Conduct surveys and experiments to measure impact of educational programs  
- Use **t-tests** and **ANOVA** for statistical validation  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Software
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📚 References
- **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** documentation  
- **Academic and industry research** on food waste and sustainability  
- **Kaggle Food Waste Dataset**

---

## ✨ Outcome
This analysis highlights how data-driven insights can be used to promote **sustainable consumption** and **reduce food waste**, contributing directly to **global food security** goals.
